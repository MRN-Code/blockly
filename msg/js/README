All the JS files inside this folder are auto-generated by the build script.
All the JS files inside this folder are gitignored.
This README file is added mainly to keep the msg/js folder while other files are gitignored
as the build script does not auto create msg/js folder when the repo is cloned first time.

May modify the builder script, but this is s simple hack.
